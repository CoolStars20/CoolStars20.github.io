    <p>A <a href="http://www.massdot.state.ma.us/highway/HighlightedProjects/CommonwealthAvenueBridgeReplacement/ProjectOverview.aspx">major
      public works project</a> will take place during the CS20 meeting,
      where a road bridge crossing an interstate close to the conference venue
      will be replaced. Thus, the area between the conference venue and the BU
      dorms will be closed to most vehicular traffic. Based on a similar
      project last year, this will not be too bad.  The lack of cars made walking
      and cycling easier.  The MBTA (The "T") will be providing free
      complimentary shuttles that will be accessible from the MBTA stop near
      the BU dorms (10 Buick Street) to/from the MBTA stop near the conference
      venue.  However, taxis, uber, and Lyft vehicles may be forced to drive
      large detours to reach the BU

      <p>The banquet will take place on the 51st floor of the Prudential Center (called "Top of the Hub"). It's about a 30 min walk from the conference venue and we expect that most participants will walk with us. If this is too far for you, please see us at the registration desk, we have a limited number of public transport tickets available (2 stops on the bus plus 2 stops on the metro).</p>

      <p>Downloadable walking instruction are available as <a href='docs/gsu_to_pc.pdf'>pdf</a>.</p>

      <p>This is a very informal affair - a tradition started a few CS meetings ago. On Friday afternoon, after the offical conference closes, we'll hold a BBQ on the Cambridge side of the river on MIT grounds (<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/George+Sherman+Union,+775+Commonwealth+Avenue,+Boston,+MA+02215/Walker+Memorial,+142+Memorial+Dr,+Cambridge,+MA+02142/@42.3541844,-71.1081034,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e379f002ffffff:0xb19e76970bb6218a!2m2!1d-71.1089505!2d42.3509182!1m5!1m1!1s0x89e370a84d9c0aa1:0x2d7d66ca4d1bdf48!2m2!1d-71.088312!2d42.3593668!3e2">Google maps</a>). We will start serving food once the caterer has finished set-up (about 1:30 pm) and continue until food runs out or 5 pm at the latest. We'll have a couple of chairs and tables, but most of you will have to sit on the grass as you casually discuss science results and say goodbye to old and new collaborators.</p>

      <p>The photo shows the Walker Court looking inwards to help you find it. When you sit there and turn around, you'll see the river and the skyline of Boston.</p>

  <h2><span>Travel</span></h2>
  <div class="c12 row">
    <h3>Travel to Boston</h3>
        <p>Logan Airport (IATA-code: BOS) is served by a large number of US and international airlines. Direct flight are offered to most major US and European airports. Several smaller airports exist in the Greater Boston area, but connecting from there to Boston is usually less convenient.
	</p>
      <h3>Transport to the Conference Venue</h3>

	<p>Public transport in Boston is provided by
	the <a href="http://mbta.com">MBTA</a>. From the airport, the "Silver
	Line" is a bus leaving right outside the Terminal. (Travel starting
	with the Silver Line from the airport is free, a measure introduced to
	reduce congestion at the airport terminals.) Stay on the bus to the
	final stop (South Station) and transfer to the Red Line (inbound to
	Alewife) for two stops ("Park Street"). Change to a Green Line train
	outbound to "Boston College". (Note that the Green Line has several
	branches, so check the destination on the train.) The Green line stop
	"Blandford Street" is a 10 min walk from the Conference Venue. Due to
	construction, the Green Line B branch terminates there. If you don't
	want to walk there are free shuttle busses every few min that can drop
	you off at "Boston University, Central" (conference venue) or
	"Saint Paul Street" (BU dorms).</p>

	<p>Both the <a href="http://mbta.com">MBTA</a> and <a href="https://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> offer a journey planner that has up-to-date timetables for all train and bus services in Boston.
	</p>

    <p>A taxi from the airport costs about 30$ (15-20% tip are expected in the US). Taxis prefer cash, but also accept all major credit cards.</p>

    <p>Popular US ride and ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft operate in Boston and will service (pick-up and drop-off) the Boston Logan Airport.  The fees are typically ~$25-35 for single rides but can fluctuate due to the demand at the time. The option to automatically share a ride with other Uber/Lyft users will significantly reduce the price.  In order to access these rides, you must install the app on your phone and have access to the internet.  Creating an account through the app and registering your credit card is required for service since the drivers will not take cash or credit.
    </p>

    <h3>Getting around in the city</h3>
    <p>Public transport in Boston is provided by the <a href="http://mbta.com">MBTA</a> and Uber and Lyft are popular services, too. However, the center of Boston is relatively small with many parks and pedestrian-friendly streets, so simply walking is often the best option to get around.</p>

    <p>In recent years, cycling has also become a lot more popular and many new bike lanes have been marked to increase safety, see <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3524676,-71.0871778,15z/data=!5m1!1e3">Google maps</a> for a map of bike routes. In particular, there is a very nice bike path along the Charles river. We want to point out two companies for providing bicycles:

      <ul class="listing">
	<li><a href="https://www.bluebikes.com/how-it-works">BLUEbikes</a>
	  offers a bike share service for $10 per day (including any number of
	  rides < 2 h during a 24 h period) or $20 per month (including any
	  number of trips < 45 min). There are two BLUEbikes docks near/at
	  BU. The bikes are not lightweight, though.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.urbanadventours.com/">Urban Adventures</a> offer a
	  variety of bikes for rent that
	  they will deliver to your hotel. They are more expensive (for their
	  hybrid city bikes, the listed price is $40 for the first 24-hours and
	  $25 for each additional day, Monday-Friday), but include helmets,
	  locks, bike lights, and flat kits. They also offer city tours.</li>
	</ul>
