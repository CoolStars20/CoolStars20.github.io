However, systematic errors arising from inaccuracies in stellar models are known to be a limiting factor in such studies, and thus it is uncertain to what extent the observed diversity of stellar abundance patterns is real. We have performed an analysis of 79 Sun-like stars within 100 parsecs and achieve abundance measurements of 30 elements with precisions of 2 percent. Systematic errors are minimized in this study by focusing on solar twin stars and performing a line-by-line differential analysis using high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise spectra. We resolve [X/Fe] abundance trends in galactic chemical evolution at precisions of $10^{-3}$ dex Gyr$^{-1}$ and reveal that stars with similar ages and metallicities have nearly identical abundance patterns.

Our solar simulations reproduce sunspot observables such as low-latitude emergence, tilting action toward the equator following the Joy's Law trend, and a phenomenon akin to active longitudes. We comment on the effect of rotation and convective flows (both local and mean) on the subsequent evolution of rising flux tubes in Suns rotating at three and five times the solar rate. Typically, rapid rotation deflects the flux tubes poleward, while strong radial flows distort the flux tube and differential rotation supplies it with added torque. Such TFT simulations share similarities, and a few differences, with buoyant magnetic structures that have recently been realized self-consistently in a unique set of convective dynamo simulations. Finally, we compare our TFT models in partially convective stars to those of fully convective M dwarfs. In these simulations computed at the solar rotation rate, the expected starspot latitudes deviate from the solar trend, favoring significantly poleward latitudes unless the differential rotation is sufficiently prograde or the magnetic field is strongly super-equipartition.

With this, we can inspect centre-to-limb variations in the local absorption line profiles shape and net velocity. In turn, this allows us to search for signatures of magnetic activity (e.g. magneto-convection, spots, faculae) and surface differential rotation (as well as determine the star-planet alignment).

The similarities in spot distribution and radii are interesting given the star\u2019s similar rotation period (29 d) but smaller mass ($0.8 M_\\odot$) than the Sun. The chromospheric emission of HAT-P-11 is consistent with an $\\sim10$ year activity cycle, which plateaued near maximum during the Kepler mission. In the cycle that we observed, the star seemed to spend more time near active maximum than minimum. We compare the log $R^\\prime_{HK}$ normalized chromospheric emission index of HAT-P-11 with other stars.

However, recently we have found that this may in fact not be the case, which would have far-reaching implications. Our team has developed a differential analysis technique that has led the field of stellar chemical abundances to unprecedented precision, about 2 percent, a five-fold improvement over traditional analyses. Our study on the Hyades revealed that this open cluster is chemically inhomogeneous at the 0.02 dex level, which could be due to pollution of gas before complete mixing of the proto-cluster cloud. Our recent study on the M67 showed a clear signature of atomic diffusing to be about 0.1 dex through the evolution stage in this benchmark open cluster. Our results thus provide significant new constraints on the chemical composition of open clusters and a challenge to the current view of Galactic archeology.

Similar brightness changes occur on our Sun, where they can be observed in detail and have been extensively studied. Thus, models for solar brightness variations have been developed for decades and provide accurate agreement with the solar observations. Since stellar variability is based on the same concepts that were used in solar irradiance models, those can be extended to investigate Sun-like stars.

The observed motions within the flaring loop neatly agree with HD model predictions, indicating that the standard flare model holds also for flares $10^4$ more energetic than the most intense solar ones.

Cool stars with exoplanets in close orbits may be a fundamental exception from the age-activity-rotation relationships which govern other cool stars. In analogy to close stellar binaries, a planet and its star are thought to interact tidally and magnetically. If the planetary orbit is shorter than the stellar rotation period, angular momentum transfer from the orbit to the stellar spin can take place. This can lead to a spin-up (or inhibited spin-down) of the host stars and a shrinking planetary orbit. In addition to this long-term evolution, planets have also been speculated to trigger stellar flares or other changes in the stellar atmosphere through magnetic interaction or accretion of evaporating exoplanetary material. Observational searches for such enhanced rotation or activity of Hot-Jupiter host stars are not straightforward due to the presence of selection effects and the stochastic nature of stellar activity itself; however, there has been progress over the past years which I will report on.

With these data, we can look into the detailed correlation of X-ray and radio flares from YSOs, including radio spectral index information. Improved VLBA capabilities now allow us to follow up hundreds of sources in an astrometric monitoring program that is producing both a definitive census of nonthermal emission and precision astrometry of embedded YSOs that remain out of reach for Gaia, thus complementing the Gaia mission by producing a proper motion survey of embedded YSOs and a rare cross-check of absolute astrometric measurements. Last but not least, we have now used ALMA to extend our scope of high-energy phenomena from gyrosynchrotron radiation in the centimeter wavelength regime to synchrotron radiation by obtaining a first systematic set of millimeter-wavelength lightcurves of Orion YSOs.

Many stars, however, form in binary or higher-order systems where orbital dynamics fundamentally alter this star-disk interaction. In short-period binaries, orbital resonances are predicted to carve out the center of the protoplanetary disk, leading to periodic accretion streams that bridge the gap between a circumbinary disk and the central stars.

The earliest-type (M0--M2) stars appear overluminous, having log(L$_{\\rm X}$/L$_{\\rm bol}$) $\\approx$ -3.0, but for spectral types M4 and later log(L$_{\\rm X}$/L$_{\\rm bol}$) decreases and its distribution broadens, with these mid- to late-M TWA stars appearing underluminous in X-rays compared to very young pre-main sequence stars of similar spectral type and luminosity. Additionally, the fraction of TWA stars that display evidence for residual primordial disk material sharply increases in this same (mid-M) spectral type regime.

It is typically assumed that starspots trap energy below a star\u2019s superadiabatic layer, forcing the star to thermally restructure to maintain thermal equilibrium. For this reason, starspots have been proposed to explain noted discrepancies between stellar evolution model predictions and measured properties of young stars, whereby measurements find real stars appear cooler than model predictions at a fixed luminosity. However, there is little observational evidence to firmly support the assumption that starspots force stars to thermally restructure. To establish where within a star energy becomes trapped, and how a star responds to the trapped energy, we develop a flexible model to predict how starspots affect a star's observable properties. We find that different families of starspot models lead to unique color-magnitude diagram morphologies that roughly correlate with the location and duration of trapped energy. We present a study of three starspot model families to explore how stellar colors and magnitudes respond to varying starspot surface coverages and temperature contrasts. The three families include: (1) short duration starspots that do not cause thermal restructuring, (2) deep rooted starspots that lead to thermal restructuring, and (3) shallow rooted starspots where trapped energy is redistributed throughout the surrounding photosphere by radiation. When compared against measured properties of real stars, our model can be used to test whether starspots are responsible for the anomalous properties of young stars and potentially delineate between different starspot formation mechanisms.\n</p>", "title": "A Flexible Model for Investigating Properties of Starspots: Model Characterization"}, {"authorlist": "Eunkyu Han; Philip S.

However, empirical measurements from the SB2 EBs often show larger than expected radii for their measured mass, metallicity and age. One proposed mechanism for this radius inflation involves strong magnetic fields arising from the rapid stellar rotation that inhibit internal convection and create starspots. Another possible explanation for inflated radii involves inaccurate modeling and quality of the data. There is a disagreement between different groups' measurements arising from using different sets of data and the EB fitting mechanism (Han et al. 2017). From this study, it is possible that other M dwarf EBs that show hyper-inflation are not inflated, and the masses and radii are inaccurate. Because these measurements directly inform the physical properties of exoplanets found to orbit isolated stars, it is important to constrain the relationships among the stellar parameters of M dwarf stars. \nTo precisely determine the mass-radius relationship for M dwarfs, we need high fidelity photometric and spectroscopic data. Thanks to the Kepler spacecraft, rich sets of high fidelity photometric data are available.

A key riddle connecting stars and hot Jupiters is in the very existence of these close-in planets. If they migrated into their orbits, why didn't they ultimately fall into their stars? Conventional models of stellar tidal dissipation, usually parameterized with a tidal dissipation constant $Q$ (about $10^5$ to $10^6$), predict orbital decay within less than the lifetime of their host stars. Hence, these hot Jupiters should have fallen into their stars long time ago. I present a new model of tidally-induced orbital evolution that is based on two-layer, 2D stellar evolution models, which suggest strong tidal dissipation due to the dynamical tide in the extended convective envelopes of young, shrinking sun-like stars. The resulting $Q$ values of about $10^3$ imply that any hot Jupiter migrating inwards would stop migration at the stellar co-rotation radius near about 0.05 AU. During the next 100 Myr - 1 Gyr, tidal dissipation decreases by orders of magnitude (while $Q$ increases to ${\\sim}10^8$) and the stellar rotation slows down due to magnetic breaking. Although hot Jupiters at 0.05 AU would soon be inside the co-rotation radius and be subject to tidal infall, this tidally-driven orbital evolution is much weaker than previously estimated due to the substantially lower tidal dissipation rates in sun-like main sequence stars. In fact, hot Jupiters as close as 0.05 AU around sun-like stars can easily survive for tens of billions of years from a tidal point of view.

Strong, extended stellar magnetic fields and high flux of incident energetic particles in particular can threaten surface life.  While the magnetic field strength and electron energy distribution are relatively well constrained for early- to mid- M dwarfs, recent observations have shown that UCD radio emission is different. For example, the Gudel-Benz relation between X-ray and radio luminosity holds for F to early M stars, but \ndrastically underpredicts radio flux for UCDs. Processes such as electron cyclotron maser instability or auroral emission fail to explain the radio flux values observed at frequencies $>$\\,30 GHz. Gyrosynchrotron radiation due to the UCDs\u2019 magnetic fields appears to be the most plausible mechanism for the observed emission, but has not been demonstrated conclusively. Gyrosynchrotron radiation is indicative of a substantial magnetic field and also accelerates electrons in stellar atmospheres to MeV energies.

The material gathers and cools near the co-rotation radius until its density becomes large enough that it is visible as a transient absorption feature in the hydrogen Balmer lines and strong resonance lines such as Ca II H\\&\\ K.  Here we present the key insight that the sonic point usually lies well below the condensation region. The flow at the wind base is therefore unaffected by the presence of an overlying prominence, so we can use the observed masses and recurrence times of the condensations to estimate the mass flux in the wind. These measurements extend the relationship between mass loss rate per unit surface area and X-ray flux to span 5 orders of magnitude.

As such, flare sequences contain information about the underlying dynamics of the stellar activity cycle, which can be seen in long-term variability of the flaring rate.  However, the distribution of flares over shorter time scales appears to be random and is thought to be well described as a nonstationary Poisson process.  The waiting time distribution of flares is thought to be produced by processes sufficiently complex to appear random, or the randomness may be a property of the evolution of the magnetic field configurations.  To understand the information contained in flare sequences, we have applied information theory to examine the flow of information.  We have found that in contrast to a Poisson process, there is significant mutual information between subsequent flares, suggesting that the dynamics is not so well described as a nonstationary Poisson process.

The eruption resulted in a relatively wide CME with a round front and prominence core. In SOHO/LASCO C2 partial halo was observed. The prominence eruption begins with a slow rise and then evolves to a fast rise phase. We first constructed a non-linear force free field (NLFFF) model of this pseudostreamer using the flux rope insertion method. The NLFFF model produces the 3D coronal magnetic field constrained by observed coronal structures and photospheric magnetogram. SDO/HMI magnetogram was used as an input for the model.

We magnetofrictionally relax the model until the flux rope expands to three solar radii and compare CME propagation with the SOHO/LASCO C2 observations. From the simulation results, we determine the process for the eruption by identifying where reconnection takes place and how much flux is reconnected. We determine the pre-eruption twist and decay index and how the twist is transferred as the simulation progresses. In addition, we perform a topology analysis of the models in order to determine the location of quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs).

This relationship manifests in a variety of phenomena that makes young stars highly variable at a wide range of wavelengths. The photometric variability of young stars can be traced back to four main origins: variable accretion, rotational modulation due to hot or cold stellar spots, variable line-of-sight extinction, and stellar flares. Here we present results on a very special young star, DQ Tau, which displays all of these effects. Thanks to the unprecedented precision of Kepler K2 and Spitzer data, we could separate the signature of the individual effects. DQ Tau is a young low-mass spectroscopic binary, consisting of two almost equal-mass stars on a 15.8 d period surrounded by a circumbinary disk. Our light curve analysis revealed that the rotational modulation appears as sinusoidal variation with a period of 3.017 d. In our model this is caused by extended stellar spots 400 K colder than the stellar effective temperature. During our 80-day-long monitoring we detected 40 stellar flares with energies up to $1.2\\times10^{35}$ erg and duration of a few hours. The flare profiles closely resemble those in older late-type stars, and their occurrence does not correlate with either the rotational or the orbital period. We observe elevated accretion rate up to $5\\times10^{-8}\\,M_{\\odot}$/yr around each periastron. Our Spitzer data suggests that the increased accretion luminosity heats up the inner part of the circumbinary disk temporarily by about 100 K. We found an inner disk radius of 0.13 au, significantly smaller than expected from dynamical modeling of circumbinary disks. Interestingly, the inner edge of the disk is in corotation with the binary's orbit. DQ Tau also shows short dips of $<$0.1 mag in its light curve, reminiscent of the well-known \"dipper phenomenon\" observed in many low-mass young stars.</p>", "title": "Spots, flares, accretion, and obscuration in the pre-main sequence binary DQ Tau"}, {"authorlist": "Nad\u00e8ge Lagarde ; C\u00e9line Reyl\u00e9 ; Annie Robin", "link": "--", "authoremail": "<a href='mailto:nadege.lagarde@utinam.cnrs.fr'>nadege.lagarde@utinam.cnrs.fr</a>", "affiliations": "Besan\u00e7on Observatory - Institut UTINAM", "loctime": "poster number: 173", "index": 132.0, "author": "Nad\u00e8ge Lagarde", "type": "poster", "abstract": "<p class=\"abstract\">The cornerstone mission of the European Space Agency, Gaia, together with complementary spectroscopic (Gaia-ESO and APOGEE) and seismic surveys (CoRoT, Kepler, and K2), will revolutionize our understanding of the formation and history of our Galaxy, providing accurate stellar masses, radii, ages, distances, as well as chemical properties for very large samples of stars across different Galactic stellar populations.</p><p class=\"abstract\">To exploit all potential of the combination between spectroscopic and seismic observations, the population synthesis approach will be a very crucial and efficient tool.

The stronger evidence is the identification of two main rotation sequences, slow and fast, in open clusters and young loose associations of ages between 100 and 600 Myr, with a gradual disappearance of the fast-rotator sequence. It has proven difficult to explain such a depletion of the fast-rotator sequence in the observed time-scale without invoking some sort of magnetic transition. Rotation breaking laws with a dependence on the cube of the rotational velocity naturally produce a convergence in rotation at a given mass, but they fail to produce the rotational evolution observed between 100 and 600 Myr, which suggest a rapid and stochastic transition from the fast to the slow-rotator sequence. It has recently been suggested that such a transition may be linked to a transition from a weak to strong core-envelope coupling in the context of a metastable dynamo model. We have recently found evidences of radius inflation in star with intermediate equatorial rotational velocity, i.e. those which are experiencing a transition between the fast- and the slow-rotator sequence. Magnetic fields are deemed responsible for radius inflation through their role in inhibiting convective and radiative energy transport. The increase in stellar radius is accompanied by a decrease of the effective temperature, such that luminosity remains approximately constant, which is not accounted for by standard stellar models. The inhibition of convection also affects those layers where lithium depletion occurs, providing further constraints on stellar interior models. The possibility that radius inflation occurs in stars undergoing some sort of magnetic transition opens new and exiting opportunities in solving long-standing issues regarding stellar structure and evolution.

(2016, ApJ 832,\u00a0121)\u00a0analyzed radial velocity measurements of a sample of 10 red giants that were observed by the Kepler space telescope, for which oscillations have been detected. They showed\u00a0that asteroseismic scalings systematically overestimate red-giants masses and radii, by about 15\u00a0and 5 percent in average, respectively. Overestimating masses lead to underestimating stellar ages, which can have important implications for ensemble asteroseismology used for galactic studies.\u00a0In this work, we present radial velocity measurements of new systems including an oscillating red giant and we compare our results to those of Gaulme et al., and the recent results from Brogaard et al. (2018, MNRAS). We confirm that asteroseismology significantly overestimates masses of red giants and we test all of the methods that have been proposed to correct possible inaccuracies of the asteroseismic scaling relations.</p>", "title": "Calibrating asteroseismology for red giants with eclipsing binaries"}, {"authorlist": "M.

Detection rates and line-ratios as a function of color can be used to interpret the stellar and circumstellar conditions that lead to detections of certain lines. In particular, BAaDE can distinguish carbon-rich and oxygen-rich sources through the detection of SiO and CS respectively, and we have found that there is a clear separation in MSX D-E (~14 microns-~21microns) color between high SiO detection rates and high CS detection rates.  This can be applied to divide C and O type stars based solely on their MSX color. In addition, this distinction can be used to more securely identify spectral lines within the BAaDE survey (in turn providing more accurate line-of-sight velocities), to select or deselect O-type stars in future surveys, and to constrain the ratio of O-type to C-type stars as a function of Galactic longitude. </p>", "title": "Selecting Carbon Stars by MSX Colors"}, {"authorlist": "S.

These data immediately reveal two striking boundary layers of shear in the solar convection zone (CZ): a tachocline at the base, where the differential rotation of the CZ transitions to solid-body rotation in the radiative zone, and a 35-Mm-thick near-surface shear layer (NSSL) at the top, where the rotation rate slows by about 5% with increasing radius. Though asteroseismology cannot probe the differential rotation of distant stars to the same level of detail that helioseismology can achieve for the Sun, it is possible that many cool stars with outer convective envelopes possess similar differential rotation characteristics, including both a tachocline and a NSSL. Here we present the results of 3D global hydrodynamic simulations of spherical-shell convection for a Sun-like star at different levels of density contrast across the shell. The simulations with high stratification possess characteristics of near-surface shear, especially at low latitudes. We discuss in detail the dynamical balance of torques giving rise to the NSSL in our models and interpret what these balances imply for the real Sun. We further discuss the dynamical causes that may serve to wipe out near-surface shear at high latitudes, and conclude by offering some theories as to how this problem might be tackled in future work.</p>", "title": "Exploring the Influence of Density Contrast on Solar Near-Surface Shear"}, {"authorlist": "L.

Rotation in the open clusters with ages up to 2.5 Gyr agreed with previous expectations, but field stars with asteroseismic ages revealed a very different behavior. Beyond middle age, the angular momentum of stars no longer appeared to decrease over time, possibly due to a shutdown of magnetic braking. Ground-based spectroscopy of the older stars revealed that chromospheric activity continues to decrease with age, even while the rotation period remains constant. For stars with known activity cycles, this transition appears to be accompanied by a gradual lengthening of the stellar cycle before it eventually becomes undetectable or disappears entirely. The TESS mission will soon provide new tests of this scenario, by yielding asteroseismic masses and ages for stars observed for decades by the Mount Wilson survey.

The coldest brown dwarf, WISE 0855, is unique amongst these objects, since its the closest known planetary-mass, free-floating object and has a temperature nearly as cold as the solar system gas giants (250 K). Like Jupiter, it is predicted to have an atmosphere rich in methane, water, and ammonia, with clouds of volatile ices. WISE 0855 is faint at near-infrared wavelengths and emits almost all its energy in the mid-infrared. Skemer et al. (2016) presented the first spectrum of WISE 0855, from 4.5\u20135.1 $\\mu$m (M band), which revealed water vapor features. We present a new spectrum of WISE 0855 in L band, from 3.4\u20134.14 $\\mu$m. Methane absorption is clearly present in the spectrum but the mid-infrared color can be better matched with a methane abundance that is somewhat depleted relative to solar abundance. There is evidence for water ice clouds in the M band spectrum. We find a lack of phosphine spectral features in both the L and M band spectra\u2014distinct from Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere, which has strong phosphine features at these wavelengths, indicating that the mixing in WISE 0855 must be different. Lastly, we suggest that a deep continuum opacity source may be obscuring the near-infrared flux, possibly a phosphorous-bearing cloud predicted by equilibrium chemistry models. Observations of WISE 0855 provide critical constraints for cold planetary atmospheres, bridging the temperature range between the long-studied solar system planets and accessible exoplanets. JWST will soon revolutionize our understanding of cold brown dwarfs with high-precision spectroscopy across the infrared, allowing us to study their compositions and cloud properties, and to infer their atmospheric dynamics and formation processes. \n</p>", "title": "The First Mid-Infrared Spectra of the Coldest Brown Dwarf"}, {"authorlist": "S.

We find that the radii are systematically inflated by at least 5 percent for a given age and luminosity when compared to the corresponding stellar model. We performed an independent check of the temperature using robust optical spectrophotometry of a sample from both clusters that spans the temperature range of the radius discrepancy.

Viewed in another light, planet-hosting M dwarfs provide a synergistic opportunity to understand the properties of both exoplanet atmospheres and M-dwarf surface active regions, as transit observations provide spatial and spectral probes of resolved stellar surfaces. Here we summarize our work on investigating the impact of spots and faculae on transmission spectra using models of rotating M-dwarf photospheres, detailing implications for characterization efforts of both small exoplanet atmospheres and M-dwarf photospheres. We find that wide ranges of spot and faculae covering fractions are consistent with typical observed variabilities of M dwarfs. Molecular absorption features in photospheric active regions can imprint apparent features in transmission spectra comparable to or an order of magnitude larger than those of atmospheric features from rocky exoplanets, complicating searches for planetary atmospheric features but also enabling constraints on temperatures and filling factors of surface active regions.

The dC stars may be the enhanced-abundance progenitors of most of these systems, but this requires a demonstrated high binary frequency for dCs. Our Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV, targeted a large sample of dC stars for repeat spectroscopy to constrain the binary frequency and orbital properties.

We set out to examine how an Earth-like planet at different geological epochs might look around other star types (Rugheimer & Kaltenegger, 2018).

We find that some of these molecules could be produced abiotically in a CO$_2$/CH$_4$/H$_2$ rich atmosphere with lighting and photochemistry. These molecules would be interesting to detect in an exoplanet atmosphere since they are known to be useful for key prebiotic chemical pathways. HCN, for example, is present at each of the initial photochemical reactions that produce lipids, amino acids and nucleosides, the three building blocks of life (Patel et al. 2015).

As such, this sample represents our first opportunity to face a challenge that will be common with future datasets: how do we interpret the information encoded in the rotation periods of a mixed and biased stellar population, particularly with respect to stellar ages?  We present a forward modeling exercise in which we attempt to reproduce the observed distribution of rotation periods in the Kepler field stars by coupling rotational evolution models to a galactic stellar population model.  We find that stars with Rossby number Ro > 2 are preferentially missing in the observed sample. We demonstrate that this threshold may correspond either to detection bias or to the onset of the weakened magnetic braking; in the latter case, it suggests that large samples of stars without detailed individual characterization can still be instrumental for refining our understanding of angular momentum evolution. We discuss future tests to robustly distinguish between these two scenarios. Second, subgiant \u201ccontaminants\u201d are common, with periods and colors entirely consistent with a dwarf population, but subject to markedly different period-age relationships. Evolutionary state information is therefore critical for the interpretation of the rotation periods, and fortunately now widely available with Gaia.

The star is confirmed to have seven planets (Gillon et al. 2017) and thus greatly interested in not only by stellar astrophysics but also by astrobiology. The stellar wind or radiation from TRAPPIST-1 is the most important research subject to comprehend the interplanetary environment of TRAPPIST-1. Several solar wind theories, which have been examined observationally, are applied to the case of TRAPPIST-1. Among them, it is the plausible idea that the dissipation of the incompressible MHD wave leads to the heating and driving the stellar wind. For instance, Garraffo et al. 2017 succeeded in the three-dimensional MHD simulation of the stellar wind from TRAPPIST-1, by extending their solar wind model in which the incompressible MHD wave is exhausted by the turbulent dissipation. The incompressible MHD wave, on the other hand, is also affected not only by the turbulent dissipation but also by the nonlinear mode coupling, which leads to the formation of the shock wave and consequently contribute to heating the wind. This nonlinear process has been well investigated to account for the dynamics of the lower solar atmosphere (Kudoh \\& Shibata 1999) and driving the solar wind (Suzuki \\& Inutsuka 2005), but not discussed for the stellar wind from TRAPPIST-1.

Because of the non-gray secular dimming, we measure the wavelength dependence of the dips separately and without the extra depth from the secular dimming. Such measurements yield a different estimate of the wavelength dependence of the dips but remains consistent with the previous measurement except for Elsie (the first dip), which is surrounded by dimming with strong wavelength dependence. We find that the range of the wavelength dependence variation of the entire 2017 light curve is consistent with optically-thin dust with an average grain radius of r$<$1 micron and the dust causing just the dips being r$<$0.5 micron.

We will give an overview of the BAaDE survey, focusing on the comparison of the SiO 43 GHz and 86 GHz transitions.  In particular, we observed 43 GHz and 86 GHz transition near-simultaneously in a subsample of the sources using the Australia Telescope Compact Array and found that on average the 43 GHz v=1 line is 1.3 times stronger than the 86 GHz v=1 line.  The presence of a detectable 43 GHz v=3 line alters the statistics, consistent with the SiO masers displaying 43 GHz v=3 emission arising in a denser regime in the circumstellar shell compared to those without.

Working with optical and near-infrared photometry from DECam and the CIDA Deep Survey of Orion, as well as public data from Hipparcos, UCAC4, VISTA and 2MASS, we selected more than 1500 photometric member candidates of 25 Ori according to their positions in color-magnitude and color-color diagrams.

Although studies have shown that the accretion termination timescale and the primordial dust disk evolution timescale may be similar, the  connection is less clear for gas disks around stars with very low accretion rates, and in particular, it is unclear how accretion stops. Here we report FUV, Optical, and NIR observations of three TTS in the Orion OB1b subassociation with an age of 5 Myr, the critical age in disk evolution in which 80 percent of disks have dissipated.

One of the accreting TTS (Classical TTS; CTTS) has a primordial disk based on the SED but shows only a marginal detection of FUV H$_2$ emission. Another CTTS has a transitional disk but shows a conspicuous excess of FUV H$_2$. The last target is a non-accretor with no primordial disk, in agreement with non-detection of FUV H$_2$.

The main advantage of solar observations with ALMA is mapping of the solar chromosphere with an unprecedented spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution in the wavelength range between 0.3 mm and 8.6 mm. It can also be used as an approximately linear thermometer - the measured brightness temperature is directly proportional to the gas temperature of the observed structure or the continuum-forming layer in the solar atmosphere. Formation height of the continuum radiation increases with increasing observing wavelength which enables very accurate measurements of solar chromosphere's temperature as a function of height. The topic is important for solar physics, but it is important for stellar physics too, since the Sun is representative for the whole class of solar-like stars (solar-stellar connection). The study has an observational and a modelling part. Within the observational part, data reduction is performed on CSV data taken in previous years and made publicly available in 2017. Models of various observed solar structures were developed and compared with actual ALMA observations. Radiation models are based on various VAL and FAL atmosphere models with thermal bremsstrahlung as the dominant mechanism responsible for the emission at ALMA wavelengths. A comparison of observations and models provides precise constraints on plasma properties in the solar atmosphere.

In addition, we analyze the biological impact of these superflares on a hypothetical Earth around Kepler-96 and the three TRAPPIST-1 planets within the HZ. Several atmospheric scenarios were tested: an Archean atmosphere and Present-day atmospheres with and without oxygen. The presence of an ocean was also included in our study.

The presence of a circumbinary disk may have an important impact on the orbital evolution of these systems. The association between disks, binarity, and the RV Tau long-term variability (i.e. RVb signature) had remained elusive until the Kepler spacecraft's observation of the RV Tau star, DF Cyg (Vega et al. 2017). Based on modeling of the Kepler light curve, radial-velocity data, and the spectral energy distribution for DF Cyg, we argued that the RVb phenomenon is likely to be fundamentally connected to a circumbinary disk revealed by infrared excess. However, as with most RV Tau stars, the lack of flux measurements longward of 20 microns restricts modeling of the SED and disk parameters. It is only at long wavelengths such as 800--1000 microns that the optically thin emission of the disk can be sampled and used to constrain key properties such as overall disk mass and total size for these systems. We have obtained flux measurements at 230 GHz for an RVb variable, U Mon, with the Smithsonian Submillimeter Array (SMA). Our SMA measurements provide a crucial lynchpin in the SED for determining the parameters of the disk surrounding these stars, while the images provide direct measurements of its size.

We introduce a new method to infer ages of M dwarfs using a combination of kinematics and alpha element enrichment, both shown to correlate with age for Sun-like FGK stars. We leverage the chemical and kinematic evolution of the Galaxy to develop a semi-empirical, probabilistic age-dating method. Utilizing new methods to directly measure titanium and iron abundances of M dwarfs from their high-resolution NIR spectra, we estimate the ages of several eccentric-planet-hosting M dwarfs. Tidal effects are expected to circularize the orbits of short-period planets around M dwarfs on short timescales. However, we find a number of mildly eccentric, close-in planets orbiting old stars. For these systems, we use our ages to constrain the tidal dissipation parameter, Q, of the planets. For two mini-Neptune planets, GJ 176 b and GJ 536 b, we find they have tidal Q values more similar to the ice giants than the terrestrial planets in our Solar System. We measure relatively old ages and high tidal Q values for GJ 436 b and GJ 876 d, suggesting they either have undergone significant tidal evolution or are influenced  by an unseen companion.

The causal dependency of the solar cycle parameters is bidirectional.  The transfer of information from the solar polar field to the sunspot number (SSN) peaks at lag time ($\\tau$) $\\sim$ 30\u201340 months, but thereafter it remains at a persistent low level for at least 400 months ($\\sim$ 3 solar cycles) for the period 1906\u20132014.  The latter may indicate the persistency of the polar fields from cycle to cycle.  It may also lend support to the idea that the polar fields from the last 3 or more solar cycles can affect the production of SSN of the subsequent cycle.  There is also a similarly long term information transfer from the SSN to the polar field.  Both the meridional flow speed and flux emergence (proxied by the SSN) transfer information to the polar field, but one transfers more information than the other, depending on the lag times.  The meridional flow speed transfers more information to the polar field than SSN at $\\tau \\sim$ 28\u201330 months and at $\\tau \\sim$ 90\u2013110 months, which may be consistent with some flux transfer dynamo models and some surface flux transport models.  However, the flux emergence transfers more information to the polar field than the meridional flow at $\\tau \\sim$ 60\u201380 months, which may be consistent with a recently developed surface flux transport model.  The transfer of information from the meridional flow to SSN peaks at $\\tau \\sim$ 110\u2013120 months ($\\sim$ 1 solar cycle), suggesting that the meridional flow can be used to predict SSN about one cycle ahead.

The optical extinction varies by at least 3 magnitudes on few hour time-scales with no obvious periodicity. The obscuration is produced by material at the inner edge of the circumstellar disk and therefore characterizing the absorbing material can reveal important clues regarding the transport of gas and dust within such disks. The inner disk of T Cha is particularly interesting, because T Cha has a transitional disk with a large gap at 0.2- 15 AU in the dust disk and allows study of the gas and dust structure in the terrestrial planet formation zone during this important rapid phase of protoplanetary disk evolution. For this reason we have conducted a comprehensive,  multi-spectral- region, observing campaign to study the UV/X-ray/optical variability of T Cha. During 2018 February/March we monitored the optical photometric and spectral variability using LCOGT and the SMARTS telescopes. These optical data provide a broad context within which to interpret our shorter UV and X-ray observations. We observed T Cha during 3 coordinated observations (each 5 HST orbits + 25 ksec XMM; on 2018 Feb 22, Feb 26, Mar 2) using HST COS/STIS to measure the UV-optical spectra and XMM-Newton to measure the X-ray energy distribution. The observed spectral changes are well correlated and demonstrate the influence of the same absorbing material in the different spectral regions. In this poster we examine which spectral features in the different spectral regions (FUV/NUV/optical/X-ray) change and by how much, and thereby determine the location of different emitting regions within the complex stellar/inner disk system relative to the absorbers along the line-of-sight to the stellar photosphere.

Lithium is destroyed in stellar interiors during the main sequence phase, and in consequence, the existence of lithium enriched giants challenges our current understanding of post-main sequence stellar evolution. Possible explanations for these atypical objects invoke either internal extra-mixing or planet engulfment by the star.\nThrough the use of models of canonical stellar evolution and planet engulfment, we show that the current definition of what is a lithium-rich giant is misleading. We show that mass, exact evolutionary stage, and metallicity are fundamental in understanding the lithium depletion pattern in giants, and in the classification of the unusual stars. In doing so, we propose a new approach to solve this long-standing problem.\nMoreover, we calculate a maximum lithium abundance that could be found in giants that have engulfed substellar mass companions, limiting lithium-rich giants formed by this mechanism. Also, based on the fundamental stellar properties obtained by surveys such as Gaia, APOGEE, and K2 we have selected different interesting samples, where we can identify the enriched giants, study the non-canonical mechanisms, and select candidates of planetary accretion. </p>", "title": "A new approach to the problem of lithium-rich giants"}, {"authorlist": "P.

The analysis procedure involves specifying wind parameters and then using the program to calculate line profiles for the Mg II (UV1) lines and a range of unblended Fe II lines. These lines represent a wide range of wind opacities and thus different heights in the atmosphere. The assumed wind properties are iterated until the predicted profiles match the observations (in this case HST/GHRS UV spectra) over as many lines as possible.  We present estimates of the wind parameters derived in this fashion for these stars and offer a comparison to wind properties previously-determined for low-gravity K stars using the same technique and similar data.

The TFOP Working Group (WG) is a mission-led effort organized to efficiently provide follow-up observations to confirm or reject planet candidates. The primary goal of the TFOP WG is to facilitate achievement of the Level One Science Requirement to measure masses for 50 transiting planets smaller than 4 Earth radii. Secondary goals are to serve any science coming out of TESS. The TFOP WG is organized as five Sub Groups (SGs). SG1 will provide seeing-limited imaging to measure blending within a candidate's aperture and time-series photometry to identify false positives and in some cases to improve ephemerides, light curves, and/or transit time variation (TTV) measurements. SG2 will provide reconnaissance spectroscopy to identify astrophysical false positives and to contribute to improved host star parameters. SG3 will provide high-resolution imaging with adaptive optics, speckle imaging, and lucky imaging to detect nearby objects. SG4 will provide precise radial velocities to derive orbits of planet(s) and measure their mass(es) relative to the host star. SG5 will provide space-based photometry to confirm and/or improve the TESS photometric ephemerides, and will also provide improved light curves for transit events or TTV measurements.

What comes later remains controversial, where periods for Kepler's asteroseismic touchstone stars have been used to argue for a reduced braking efficiency at older ages. However, this effect should not affect K dwarfs (0.6-0.9 $M_\\odot$), which are even more problematic to age-date with isochrone methods than F and G dwarfs. The difficulty with calibrating K dwarfs gyrochronology is that few are known with published periods that have precise ages older than the Hyades or Praesepe (650 Myr). This is because asteroseismology is not effective for this class of stars and those located in the older clusters surveyed with {\\it Kepler} (NGCs 6811 and 6819) are too faint.

There are many variables and degeneracies working simultaneously. However, there is a key parameter for characterising the action of the stellar dynamo, which is also needed to determine, magnetic fields, inclinations, age, precise chemical abundances, etc. This parameter is the rotational period. Taking advantage of the connection between photometric variations and the rotational period, we developed a new method to retrieve accurate stellar periods. We derive the rotation periods based on the Gradient of the Power Spectra (GPS) of brightness time-series. To test and calibrate our method, we use high-stability and high-sensitivity measurements of the total solar irradiance (TSI) by the SORCE/TIM and the SoHO/VIRGO instruments, detailed models of solar brightness variations and, high-quality photometric data acquired by the Kepler mission.

One of the observable tests for migration theories is the current value of the obliquity, the angle between the stellar spin axis and the normal to the orbital plane. But after the main migration mechanism has ended, the combined effects of tidal dissipation and the magnetic braking of the star lead to the evolution of both the obliquity and the semi-major axis. \nI will present an improved model for the tidal evolution of the obliquity. This model uses an analytical ab-initio estimation of tidal dissipation based on the physical properties of the host star, and tied to a known mechanism, the excitation and damping of inertial waves in convection zones. We find that tidal dissipation in convective envelopes of low-mass stars is mainly driven by their rotational evolution on the main-sequence. In the range of mass of stars developing a radiative core and a convective envelope, more massive stars remain fast rotators until the end of the main sequence, as a consequence of a less efficient magnetic braking. Thus we predict that their dissipation is not significantly reduced compared to the one of less massive stars. For typical orbital configurations of hot-Jupiters, the damping timescale of the obliquity is then generally shorter than that of the semi-major axis, due to different contributions associated to the components of the dynamical tide. Nevertheless, our simulations do not to produce slower tidal evolution of the obliquity for more massive stars. Thus this would fail to explain the correlation between effective temperature and obliquity  observed in well characterised systems. The model needs to be expanded to treat the dissipation in radiative zones, and better magnetic braking laws.

We report a number of findings:  1) The NGC 6819 dwarf masses go as low as that exhibiting the Li plateau (A(Li)~2.8) seen in late-F dwarfs cooler than the Li-Dip.  The Li-Dip is a severe non-standard Li depletion discovered in Hyades (650Myr) mid-F dwarfs, created during the MS after the Pleiades age (100Myr).  Various lines of evidence suggest rotational mixing creates the Li-Dip, although diffusion may also play a role.  We find that the mass range of the Li-Dip in NGC 6819 is similar to that in the Hyades and Praesepe (650Myr), but the Li depletion is more severe in the cool side of the Li-Dip, and, unlike Hyades/Praesepe, {\\it all} stars are severely Li-depleted.  2) Where is the transition between low-mass dwarfs that spin down and higher-mass stars?  As our dwarfs more massive than the Li-Dip evolve toward the red-hook just below the MS turnoff, from 1.5Gyr (early-F) to 2.3Gyr (mid-F), they spin down from a range of 20-90km/sec to the much narrower range of 10-25km/sec.  They also deplete their Li, creating a second Li-Dip at a higher mass than the traditional Li-Dip.  3) Standard subgiant Li dilution is expected to decrease the surface A(Li) as the surface convection zone deepens, and establish a diluted Li plateau on the RGB.  But rotational mixing during the MS and/or later can cause dilution to begin earlier, influence the shape of the Li-Teff relation, deplete Li to levels lower than the standard plateau, and affect the length of the Li-Teff plateau.  Thermohaline mixing can further deplete Li on the upper RGB.  Our clusters show evidence of all three processes but to varying degrees from cluster to cluster.  4) Some stars show higher A(Li) than their CMD neighbors.

We determined the rotational phase of each flare and performed a simple statistical test on our sample to determine whether the phase distribution of the flares is random or if there is a preference for phase. We find, with the exception of one star which is in a known binary system, that none show a preference for the rotational phase of the flares.

A number have been detected as radio sources \u2013 in some cases, emitting periodic radio pulses. Detections of optical variability in ultracool dwarfs have primarily been attributed to stellar rotation, coupled with either magnetic spots on the surface, the presence of atmospheric dust, or auroral emission. It is possible that a mix of these mechanisms is required to explain some dwarf light curves. Several studies of 2MASSW J0746425+200032AB (hereafter 2M J0746AB), a brown dwarf binary pair (spectral types L0 + L1.5) showed periodic optical variability with periods of approximately 3.3 hours. This signal is presented mainly from one component of the binary. A report of periodic 4.86 GHz radio emission with a 2.07 $\\pm$ 0.002 hours period due to the secondary component has, so far, not been matched by a corresponding optical detection of the secondary period. Here, we report on 140 hours monitoring in I-band of 2M J0746AB during three epochs in 2017, using the GUFI photometer (Galway Ultra-Fast Imager) on the 1.8m Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT), on Mt.

Utilizing our in-house GUFI Pipeline, all three epochs yielded a rotation period of ~ 3.3 hr from the slower component, with an amplitude of ~ 0.01 magnitude, consistent with previous studies.

Because mass is the key independent variable, the most direct tests of models use dynamical mass measurements. We present results from two long-term programs to measure masses in complementary ranges, from late-K stars to the bottom of the main sequence and from the substellar boundary to methane-bearing T dwarfs. The cool star sample is focused on stars with low enough mass ($<0.7\\,M_{\\odot}$) that they do not evolve significantly over the age of the Universe and thus form a tight mass--luminosity relation. The brown dwarf sample extends down to 30\\,$M_{\\rm Jup}$, providing the strongest tests of substellar cooling tracks. Both samples use high-precision astrometry from Keck AO to determine orbits, and the brown dwarf sample also includes infrared astrometry from a decade-long program at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope to obtain photocenter orbits that enable individual mass measurements. The primary result from the cool star sample is an empirical mass--metallicity--magnitude relation that provides masses accurate to 4\\% or better from 0.7\\,$M_{\\odot}$ to 0.075\\,$M_{\\odot}$ using only $K_S$-band absolute magnitudes. Comparison of this empirical relation to models indicates that the impact of metallicity on $K_S$-band flux is observed to be significantly weaker than models predict. The brown dwarf masses probe the L/T transition in detail for the first time, revealing a remarkably weak dependence of luminosity on mass that implies substellar cooling decelerates as clouds disappear and reinforces the need for accurate cloud models.  Overall, the brown dwarf masses validate modern substellar cooling models, and we derive brown dwarf cooling ages using the models to enable a novel direct determination of the age distribution of field brown dwarfs (median age of 1.3 Gyr) that is consistent with a constant star formation history over 10 Gyr.</p>", "title": "Dynamical Masses of Cool Stars and Brown Dwarfs"}, {"authorlist": "G.

While coronagraphs and point spread function (PSF) subtraction can be used to dig out signals of companions under the PSF, there are still significant limitations in separation and contrast. Non-redundant aperture masking interferometry (NRM or AMI) can be used to detect companions well inside the PSF of a diffraction limited image, though the technique is severely flux limited since the mask discards $\\sim$95% of the light gathered by the telescope. Kernel-phase analysis applies interferometric techniques similar to NRM to an unobscured diffraction limited image. Instead of non-redundant closure-phases, kernel-phases are constructed by simulating a redundant interferometer with a grid of points covering the full telescope aperture. I have developed a new faint companion detection pipeline which analyzes kernel-phases utilizing Bayesian model comparison. I demonstrate this pipeline on archival HST/NICMOS images of nearby brown dwarfs, refining astrometry of previously known companions and searching for new companions in order to constrain binary formation models at separations inaccessible to previous techniques. Using this method, it is possible to detect a companion well within the classical $\\lambda/D$ diffraction limit using a fraction of the telescope time as NRM.

Models tend to predict that young stars should be warmer and smaller than observations suggest. Attempts to explain these anomalies often invoke so-called non-standard physics, such as magnetic fields and starspots. To assess whether these hypotheses provide plausible explanations, we developed a flexible model to investigate how starspots affect stellar structure and photometric magnitudes. We present results of an effort to validate predictions from our starspot model by cross validating against a large set of synthetic clusters with random richness, age, and starspot properties. We recover the input starspot properties with a precision of 13 percent in surface coverage and 10 percent in temperature contrast, provided the starspot surface coverage is above 20 percent. If starspots occupy less than 20 percent of the stellar surface, photometric variations between different families of starspot models are largely indistinguishable in color-magnitude diagrams, confounding our recovery effort. Our ability to correctly predict starspot properties is largely independent of the cluster richness and age. These results suggest that our starspot model can be used to reliably predict properties of starspots required to rectify noted stellar evolution model discrepancies among cool stars in young open clusters. \n</p>", "title": "A Flexible Model for Investigating Properties of Starspots: Model Validation"}, {"authorlist": "A.

Magnetic variability is commonly observed in Sun-like stars, and the changing strength and topology of the global field is expected to effect the torque exerted by the stellar wind. We use three different methods for computing the angular momentum loss in the solar wind. Two are based on MHD simulations and scaling relationships from Finley & Matt (2018), plus observed mass loss rates for the solar wind. One using the open flux in the solar wind and one using remotely-observed surface magnetograms. Both methods agree in the variation of the solar torque seen through the solar cycle, showing a factor of 0.6 - 0.7 decrease in the average torque between cycle 23 and 24. The two methods calculate different average values, $2.88 \\times 10^{30}$erg for the open flux and $0.70 \\times 10^{30}$erg for the surface field method. This discrepancy is a result of the already well-known difficulty with reconciling the surface magnetograms with observed open flux, which is currently not understood and thus leads to an inability to discriminate between these two calculated torques. The third method is based on the observed spin-rates of Sun-like stars, which decrease with age and thus directly probe the average angular momentum loss. This method gives $6.20 \\times 10^{30}$erg for the averaged solar torque, larger than the other two methods, which could have a few explanations, but notably may be indicative of further variability in the solar torque on timescales much longer than the magnetic cycle. This will impact future applications of the formula to other Sun-like stars, where only surface field measurements are available.\n</p>", "title": "The Effect of Magnetic Variability on Angular Momentum Loss for the Sun and Other Stars"}, {"authorlist": "D. \u00d3 Fionnag\u00e1in; A.

Recently, it has been suggested that winds of solar-type stars might undergo a change in properties at old ages, whereby stars older than the Sun would be less efficient in carrying away angular momentum than what was traditionally believed. Additionally, recent observations suggest that old solar-type stars show a break in coronal properties, with a steeper decay in X-ray luminosities and temperatures at older ages. We use these X-ray observations to constrain the thermal acceleration of winds of solar analogues. Our sample is based on solar twins from the `Sun in time' project with ages between 120-7000 Myr. The break in X-ray properties leads to a break and steeper decay in mass-loss rates after 2 Gyr. The latter could be the reason why older stars are less efficient at carrying away angular momentum, which would explain the anomalously rapid rotation observed in older stars.

We develop a model that explains the observed lack of CBPs via coupled stellar-tidal evolution of isolated binary stars. Tidal forces between low-mass, short-period binary stars on the pre-main sequence slow the stellar rotations, transferring rotational angular momentum to the orbit as the stars approach the tidally locked state. This transfer increases the binary orbital perRevealing the Complex Environmentiod, expanding the region of dynamical instability around the binary, and destabilizing CBPs that tend to preferentially orbit just beyond the initial dynamical stability limit. After the stars tidally lock, we find that angular momentum loss due to magnetic braking can significantly shrink the binary orbit, and hence the region of dynamical stability, over time impacting where surviving CBPs are observed relative to the boundary. We perform simulations over a wide range of parameter space and find that the expansion of the instability region occurs for most plausible initial conditions and that in some cases, the stability semi-major axis doubles from its initial value. We examine the dynamical and observable consequences of a CBP falling within the dynamical instability limit by running N-body simulations of circumbinary planetary systems and find that typically, at least one planet is ejected from the system. We apply our theory to the shortest period Kepler binary that possesses a CBP, Kepler-47, and find that its existence is consistent with our model.

Such objects may preferentially form at larger separations by GI in circumstellar disks and, in the presence of an additional more massive, distant companion, be scattered inwards via the Kozai mechanism.
